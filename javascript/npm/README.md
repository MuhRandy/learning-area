# npm

npm (no capitals!) is a package manager - a gigantic repository of plugins, libraries, and other tools, which provides us with a command-line tool we can use to install these tools (that we call “packages”) in our applications. We will then have all our installed packages’ code locally, which we can import into our own files. We could even publish our own code to npm!
